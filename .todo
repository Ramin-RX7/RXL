[Syntax]

    ☐ @easy Using re.compile instead of re.match/re.search
    ?  @easy "until & unless & foreach & func" replace or regex
    ☐ @easy Check lines for all conditions until there's nothing to translate
    ☐ @easy Syntax Conditions Order (By Usage)
    ☐ @easy 'foreach' New Syntax:  "foreach iterable[item]: pass"
    ☐ @hard Console support RX syntax ( '\n'.join(Syntax([line])) )
    ?  @hard Split line by strings, check_syntax spliteds ,connect them again
            ( I can get out part of ''/"" then use .replace() )
    ☐ @hard Function to check if expression is not in Quotes
              func and Check_Type
              &memory
              until
              unless
              foreach
    ☐ @hard Not all conditions should be 'elif' in Syntax()
    ☐ @hard goto for For loops with naming For loops  (:NAME & goto NAME)
    ☐ @hard do_when Keyword for Calling specifiec function when condition comes True
    ☐ @hard There couldnt be nested Switch-Case statements
    ☐ do_while check for outline

    $_family:
        ?  All `$commands` be in one condition (faster or not?)

        ☐ @easy $check & $ $checkwait should be combined and be in the same "if" in Syntax()
            also $test
        ☐ @easy $call: accept args ('with')
        ☐ @easy $checkwait: make while true to only break when there's no exception
            extra lines that are needed in "check" and "checkwait" should be removed

    Include:
       ☐ @med *:*
       ☐ @med class:*
       ☐ @med Very Very Slow
       ☐ @med Wrong translation when using '#'
