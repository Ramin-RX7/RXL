[MAIN]
    ☐ @med @hard add a README
    ☐ @high @norm Better `test` implementation
    ☐ Compile implementation
        ☐ @med @norm Switch to `nuitka` from `pyinstaller` and `cxfreeze`
        ☐ exe doesn't accept args in `pyinstaller`
    ☐ create_MiniStd implementation
    ☐ @med Be [more] based on OOP
    ☐ @low @easy apply the own type of iterable after using apply()
    ☐ @med @easy "apply" instead of "map" --> Does not work when compiling with "pyinstaller"
    ☐ @med @easy END OF LINES ERROR IN RED (EOL)
    ☐ @low @easy Run file with double clicking
    ☐ @high @hard Improve Exception Catching when runing file
    ☐ @med @hard Add/Remove/Change some built-in objects methods
          like:   map (-> apply)
          ('forbiddenfruit' only works on linux)
    ☐ @med @easy Ignore module loading output error
    ☐ @high @easy Annotations and Documentation (Docstring/Help)
    ?  @easy Cache use `hash` of file instead of `mdftime`
    ?  @easy Check for cache in local directory of RX.py (not relative to running file)
    ?  @easy Blank line before all errors
    ?  &&  ---  ||
    ?  Generate:yield(:None)
    ?  A file to repair files (save all files in a zipfile)
    ✘?  Stop Imports
    ✘  No Break if there is python code in Base Lines
    ✘ CONST at the beginning
    ✔ Better terminal argument parser implementation (maybe even using 3rd party modules)
    ✔ @easy Using __pycache__ dir for as cache dir
    ✔ @high @norm @RXL-Lib better `array` implementation

    Load Modules:
        ☐ @med What happens if we use cache and loaded module has changed
        ☐ @med Load modules with default Options
        ☐ switch-case works fine in normal run but is not translated when loading

    Full debug:
        ☐ @med Synchronize all DEBUGs
        ☐ @hard Debug with running linters

    CONSTs:
        ☐ @high @norm better `const` implementation
        ☐ @med Fix Const func to accept one object
        ☐ @med Constants Check for Error
        ☐ @med Const Func: Accepts args only with the name and type that is specified
        !  @med After NameError rest of code will be ignored

    Installation:
      1. Script method
        ☐ scripts/RXL.exe
        ☐ All the `RXL` modules should be in the package dir (lib/site-packages/RXL/)
      2. Stand-alone method
        ☐ Add directory to the path



[Syntax]

    ☐ @med Check syntax erros with fuzzy string matching
    ☐ @critical @med `load` is unsafe (as it will be run from terminal)
    ☐✔@easy Using re.compile instead of re.match/re.search
    ?  @easy "until & unless & foreach & func" replace or regex
    ☐ @med@easy Check lines for all conditions until there's nothing to translate
    ☐ @low @easy `Syntax` Conditions Order (By Usage)
    ☐ @med @easy 'foreach' New Syntax:  "foreach iterable[item]:"
    ☐ @high @hard Console support RX syntax ( '\n'.join(Syntax([line])) )
    ☐ @high @hard Split line by strings, check_syntax spliteds ,connect them again
            ( I can get out part of ''/"" then use .replace() )
    ☐ @high @hard Function to check if expression is not in Quotes
              func and Check_Type
              &memory
              until
              unless
              foreach
    ☐ @high @hard Not all conditions should be 'elif' in Syntax()
    ☐ @high @hard There couldnt be nested Switch-Case statements
    ☐ @low @easy Use re.X as flag for better regex

    $ family:
        ☐ checkwait: add delay and maximum attempt number
        ?  All `$commands` be in one condition (faster or not?)
        ☐ @easy $check & $ $checkwait should be combined and be in the same "if" in Syntax()
            also $test
        ☐ @easy $call: accept args ('with')
        ☐ @easy $checkwait: make while true to only break when there's no exception
            extra lines that are needed in "check" and "checkwait" should be removed

    Include:
       ☐ @med @easy *:*
       ☐ @med @easy class:*
       ☐ @high @norm Very Very Slow
       ☐ @med @hard Wrong translation when using '#'



[Definde-Structure]
    ☐ Allow reload implementation
    ? set default cache flag
    ?✘ make a module out of defined structures and add `from module import *`
        (so only one line would be added to the file)
    ✔ improve regex



[Options]
    ☐ @low @easy Ignore Reloading LOADED_PACKAGES Option
    ☐ @med @easy Make Dict for "if args.option" in Get_Args()



[Extension]
    ☐ @high @hard Recreate the extension from scratch
        by now it is only a copy of `python` extension with some additions
    ?  @easy Clear the screen in extension run (? get operating system for cls/clear)
    ?  Correct color for Options in extension (and also ignore cases)
    ☐ @med @easy Internet class functions



[New Features]
    ☐ @med @norm Static-Class
    ☐ @med @norm Enums
    ☐ @med @norm @RXL-Lib Dataclasses



[Canopy]
    ☐ @high Remaining Syntax:
        Type-Scanner
        foreach
        func
        const
        do while
        $checkwait
